            <p>
                Founded in December 2024, <strong>Storni’s Auction House</strong> has quickly become a trailblazer in the world of art auctions, specializing in both <strong>digital</strong> and <strong>nautical</strong> artworks. Our mission is to offer collectors and art enthusiasts a curated selection of groundbreaking pieces that span both the digital frontier and the timeless beauty of the sea.
